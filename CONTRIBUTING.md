# Contributing to Ravi

We love your feedbacks! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a bug fix
- Proposing new features

If you are suggesting new features, please discuss them with us in the [support server](https://discord.gg/gv2vjKqZP7) by creating a support ticket, before you start working on them!

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Make sure you know how Git Flow works before contributing! 
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

## Report bugs using [Github Issues](https://github.com/Jeffreyz1129/ravibot.website.api/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new Issue](https://github.com/Jeffreyz1129/ravibot.website.api/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What *actually* happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
