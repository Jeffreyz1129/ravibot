**Getting Started**

The first step is to make sure the bot is actually in your guild! You can invite the bot to guilds you have Manage Server permissions.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, **ravi** will ask for Administrator permissions, and it is highly recommended that you grant them. You may also customize the bots's permissions by editing the the bot's role. See [FAQ](https://ravi-docs.gitbook.io/ravi-documentaion/faq) for more details on customizing permissions.
