# Guide

## let's go through all the things you can do with Ravi! :3 <a href="#lets-go-through-all-the-things-you-can-do-with-the-kbots-3" id="lets-go-through-all-the-things-you-can-do-with-the-kbots-3"></a>

**IMPORTANT:**\
**- The Ravi** must have administrator permissions on its role. KEEP IT!\
**-** No you can not change the bots prefix ( sorry ).\
\- Ticketing commands have a 1-minute cooldown to reduce rate limit issues, meaning ( slow ).

**Getting Started**

The first step is to make sure the bot is actually in your guild! You can invite the bot to guilds you have Manage Server permissions.\
\
By default, **Ravi** will ask for Administrator permissions, and it is highly recommended that you grant them. You may also customize the bot's permissions by editing the bot's role. See [FAQ](https://ravi-docs.gitbook.io/ravi-documentaion/faq) for more details on customizing permissions.

**Important:** Giving **Ravi** Administrator permissions to ensure functionality.
