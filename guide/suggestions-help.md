# Suggestions help

How do I set the suggestion modules? Setting the suggestion module is just very simple, here's an example of setting them below:

As you can see when enabling the suggestion module there are two options:\
&#x20;\
this allows the suggestion module to be turned on and off anytime it's configured.

Then the next step is to set the suggestions channel by running the command:\
\
`!setsuggestionschannel <#channel>`&#x20;

the documentation syntax will ask you what you would like to set the suggestions channel to, because of `<#channel>` you must mention the channel. And finally, after setting up the system, you can see the bot sent the message to the channel for suggestions. You can always reconfigure the suggestions channel under no limit. Just know that each guilds will only allow one suggestions channel unless the settings has been reconfigured.
