# partnership help

side note: this feature of the bot is still yet to be in beta, so there won't be any more updates on this part of the bot system.

## How do I set the partnership module with the bot?

* In order to set up the partnerships module, you first **want to turn the module** either **on or off.**\
  here is a quick example of setting the modules on or off, see below for a detailed explanation:
* You want to first turn both of the modules on for both modules to work perfectly, then once you have turned them on. The next step is to set up the pm/am role. see below for a detailed explanation.

**Important:** You want to make sure that the bot needs to be above the pm/am role in order to grant permissions to give roles to the user & you must display the bot role for it as well for it to work properly.
