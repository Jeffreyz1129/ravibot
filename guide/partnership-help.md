## How do I set the partnership module with the bot?

* In order to set up the partnerships module, you first **want to turn the module** either **on or off.**\
  here is a quick example of setting the modules on or off, see below for a detailed explanation:

* you want to first turn both of the modules on for both modules to work perfectly, then once you have turned them on. The next step is to set up the pm/am role. see below for a detailed explanation.

**Important:** You want to make sure that the bot needs to be above the pm/am role in order to grant permissions to give roles to the user & you must display the bot role for it as well for it to work properly.

* now moving on to setting up the pm/am messages, see below to see how it is configured.\\

* If you want to reedit your apm msg you can just do `[prefix]setpmmsg [message]` it again to edit it. Now lest move on to setting the pm/am channels.

* next, we are going to rank a member using the command `[prefix]add pm [user/UserID]` | `[prefix]add am [user/UserID]` but just make sure that you should have the bot role above the pm/am role if you want to grant the bot to give roles to the member.
